<div id="msgcns!192788B236F6126B!160" class="bvMsg">
<div>When it comes to power management on most electronic devices, things are pretty simple. There's  "off, " and then there's  "on. " But computers, particularly those running Windows, have always been more complicated. On is on, of course. For off, though, Windows XP machines offer several options &#8212; including hibernate, stand by and shut down.</div>
