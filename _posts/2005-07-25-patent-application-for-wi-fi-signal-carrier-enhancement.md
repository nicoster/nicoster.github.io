I farted in my room this morning and noticed that my wifi speed suddenly increased 5-folds&#8230;
Now considering selling bottled fart for improving air quality and transmission speed.
I need a bath tub&#8230;

Dear Ir.liew
RE: Patent Application for Wi-Fi Signal Carrier Enhancement.
We thank you for your application, but regret that we are unable to grant you copyright for farting. Our IT technicians have tested your method of Wi-Fi enhancement with unpredictable results. Out of five tests conducted, only one yielded a 0.01% increase in speed, whilst three resulted in network being disconnected; and the final test ended in soiled pants.
May we also remind you that extended bouts of farting in closed environments can turn the air volatile. During the test, one of our technicians, smoking a cigarette, had his smock and hair set ablaze when a stray fart ricocheted.
If you wish to resubmit your patent application, please note to disclose the ingredients of the foodstuff that was used to create your particular fart. If you cannot recall the exact ingredients, you may submit a sample for analysis. Please submit only the gaseous sample and not the solids.
Thank you.
Yours faithfully,
Wee Kan FattPatents Office. </font></div>
