Windows XP was the first client release of the Windows NT code base to ship without corresponding server versions. Instead, development continued on what became Windows Server 2003 for over a year after the release of Windows XP. Therefore, the core system files are not identical for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Even so, the differences are not major (and in many cases, components were unchanged).
