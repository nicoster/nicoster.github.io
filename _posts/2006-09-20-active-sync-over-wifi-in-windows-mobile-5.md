This is mostly for anyone searching with Google <img src='http://nick.luckygarden.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Another MVP recently asked for clarification on an issue:
Q: Does Active Sync 4 prevent syncing over WiFi, or do <span class="searchword">WM5</span> devices not sync over WiFi AT ALL.
There are 2 issues here:
<ol>
<li>Can a <span class="searchword">WM5</span> device sync to an Exchange server (Server Active Sync) over WiFi </li>
<li>Can a <span class="searchword">WM5</span> device sync to a PC (Active Sync 4) over WiFi</li>
</ol>
There appears to be some confusion about this out in the world. The definitive answer, from <a href="http://www.fastchicken.co.nz/blog/ct.ashx?id=72d49a15-c2a2-40c2-87f2-1d37dab8053b&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.geekzone.co.nz%2f">geekzone.co.nz</a> as well as Microsoft is:
<ul>
<li>A Windows Mobile 5 device CAN sync to an Exchange Server (Server Active Sync) using any method available to it (including WiFi). </li>
<li>A Windows Mobile 5 device CAN sync to a PC (Active Sync 4) using Bluetooth, Serial, IR and USB Only. It definitely CAN NOT use WiFi OR Ethernet.</li>
</ul>
<span class="searchword">WM5</span> Windows Mobile Active Sync WiFi <span class="searchword">Wireless</span> (keyword-o-rama)
&#8230;  "possibly Ethernet "&#8230; 
Nope, Ethernet is not allowed, wired or <span class="searchword">wireless</span>&#8230;  </div>
